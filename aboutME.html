    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hello!, my name is Marcel Gallardo Perez im born and raised in Calgary, AB
      Canada and am currently 25 Years old. My heritage is from Guatemala a
      small country in latinamerica its right under mexico im fortunate to have
      familly there and often visit them. <br />
      I am in my 3rd year of the Information techlology program at SAIT.
    </p>
    <h3>Why did I choose IT</h3>
    <p>
      I initially wanted to become a police officer so i went to Mount Royal
      University and took a criminal justice course. During this time i realized
      that it was not for me im a very visual person who likes to physically
      interact with information if possible and my course was mainly essays,
      reading and memorization. I then wanted to see if a trade would be better
      for me since i like to work with my hands so I went to a welding workshop
      and I simply did not like the level of work required to simply try and get
      a job. You have to apprentice for a long time without pay while working 8
      hours this aopng with an eye condition i have did not line up with the
      career. With both options burned i decided i would jump in head first with
      no knowlage into programming and computers and i found that i loved to
      program. What clicked was the promblem solving aspect of it and the real
      time improvment you see in each line as you slowly build a program and im
      know in my 3rd semester.
